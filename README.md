# RDVeryHard
 Adds a very hard difficulty to Rhythm Doctor, changing its hit margins to 25 ms.

## Installation
1. Download the latest version of BepInEx 5 **x86** [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases). \
**Make sure you use the x86 version!** RD is x86 so the x64 version of BepInEx will not work.
2. Unzip the file into your RD folder. You should have a `winhttp.dll`, `doorstop_config.ini`, and `BepInEx` folder next to Rhythm Doctor.exe.
3. Launch RD once to generate BepInEx files.
4. Download the latest version of the mod from [here](https://github.com/RandomGuyJCI/RDVeryHard/releases). It should be named `vx.x.x.zip`.
5. Unzip the file you downloaded into your Rhythm Doctor installation folder. You should now have a file at `BepInEx/Plugins/RDVeryHard/RDVeryHard.dll`.
6. Launch the game, and the plugin should automatically enable.
7. Optional: Install the [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) to configure the mod with a GUI.

For more information, check out the [BepInEx installation guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html).

*Note: For best results, it is recommended to set your in-game difficulty to Hard, even if the plugin's not directly affected by it.*
*You can also toggle the plugin any time by going to `BepInEx/Config/com.rhythmdr.veryhard.cfg` and changing the `EnableVeryHard` parameter.*
